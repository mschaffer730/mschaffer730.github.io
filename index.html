<h1>Why I Run</h1>
<div>
<p>Running was something I had never done outside of playing a specific sport. I was never someone who like to just go for a jog, and never in my dreams thought I would be running a Marathon. But as I got older, adn started to get more into fitness, running has become one of my main sources of exercising.</p>

<h3>My First Race</h3>
<p>After running for a few months as a form of exercise, I decided it was time to try my hand a running a race. So I went online and did a Google search to see what races were coming up in the area and landed on the Wheaton 5k.</p>

<h3>My First Half Marathon</h3>
<p>After running that first 5k in Wheaton, I ran about 4-5 races a year, none longer than a 15k. In my head that was great and I never thought i'd ever want to run a distance longer than that. Well I was wrong! In November of 2016, I competed my first half marathon in Philadelphia. It was an incredible experience.</p>
